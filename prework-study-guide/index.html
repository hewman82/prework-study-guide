        <ul>
          <li>Allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Adds effects, interactivity, data communication,etc.</li>
          <li>Tools developed on top of the core system include Application Programming Interfaces, sets of features and rules that exist inside a software program, enabling interation with it through software; the interface between the application offering it and other items, such third party software of hardware.</li>
          <li>Case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Weakly typed language- Allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves masmatched types, instead of throwing type errors.</li>
          <li>Dynamic type language- Variables can assigned and re-assigned values of all types.</li>
            
          <li>Variables: Containers that store values, declared with let keyword.</li>
          <li>Strings: A sequence of text assigned as the value of a variable, written in single or double quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Numbers</li>
          <li>Boolean: True/False statement</li>
          <li>Array: A structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li>Index: The location of a data item in an array. Indices are whole numbers, starting at 0, that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>Object: Anything; everything in Javascript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
          <li>Operator: A mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values.</li>

          <li>Assignment: =, Assigns a value to a variable</li>
          <li>Strict equality: ===, Performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type, returns a Boolean result.</li>
          <li>Not, Does-Not-Equal-To: !, !===, Tests whether two values are not equal and returns a Boolean result.</li>
          <li>Conditionals: Code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not, such as if...else.</li>
          <li>Functions: A way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse; allows you to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.</li>
          <li>Comments: Text marked with // that the code will ignore.</li>
          <li>Semicolons: Obligitory when you have two or more statements on the same line, used after each statement as best practice,</li>
          <li>Control flow: The order in which a computer executes code in a script. Javascript runs code from the first statement at the top of the page down to the last statement at the bottom of the page. Conditional statements and loops are used to control the order in which code is executed.</li>
