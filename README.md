# Pre-Work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide for boot camp students going through the prework modules. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This guide organizes important information covered during the prework and helps students to review and study. While working on this project, I learned the basic uses of different coding languages and how to create and merge branches with Git to track and update changes to the code.
